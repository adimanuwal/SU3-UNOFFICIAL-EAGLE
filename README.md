# SU3-UNOFFICIAL-EAGLE
This repository provides access to python routines and bash scripts that are relevant for processing the data from the EAGLE simulations. It is a collective effort by the researchers at ICRAR who work with the EAGLE data. The routines uploaded here are comparatively general purpose. For more specialised routines, please refer to the following links:
